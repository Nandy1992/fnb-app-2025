                <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.Two species are traditionally recognised, the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asians elephant (Elephans maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species(L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan Africa,South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea;other, now extinct , members of the only order include deinotheres, gomphotheres,mammoths,and mastodons.Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4m (13ft) and weight 7 ,000kg(15, 000lb).</p>
                <p>All elephants have seversl distinctive features , the most notable of which is a  long trunk or proboscis,used for many purposes, particulary breathing ,lifting water and grasping object.Their incisors grow into tucks ,which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging .Eleplants' large ear flaps help to contrl their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight . African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs ,forests, desertd and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
